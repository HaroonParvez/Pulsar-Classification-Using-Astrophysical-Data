# Pulsar Classification Using Astrophysical Data

🔍 This academic project focuses on using **machine learning techniques** to classify pulsars based on features extracted from radio signal data.

The dataset was derived from the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey and includes multiple statistical parameters from the integrated pulse profile.
